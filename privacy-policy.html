    <h1>Privacy Policy for Guess the Flag</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 23, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how Guess the Flag ("we", "our", or "the app") handles your information.
        We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Guess the Flag is designed with your privacy in mind. We collect minimal, non-personal information to understand how the app is used and to improve your experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Analytics Data</h2>
    <p>
        We use Google Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous, aggregated usage data. This helps us understand:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How users interact with different game modes and features</li>
        <li>Which difficulty levels are most popular</li>
        <li>App stability and performance metrics</li>
        <li>General user engagement patterns</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>What we collect:</strong> Game mode usage, difficulty level selections, session duration, quiz completion rates, and feature interactions. This data is completely anonymous and aggregated.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Data Retention:</strong> Firebase Analytics data is automatically deleted after 60 months (5 years) of inactivity.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Your Control:</strong> You can disable analytics collection at any time through the app's Settings menu. When you disable analytics, no new data is sent to Firebase, though previously collected data cannot be deleted.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Stored Locally</h2>
    <p>The following data is stored only on your device and never transmitted to our servers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Game Progress:</strong> Your best scores for each difficulty level</li>
        <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> Your selected language preference and analytics consent choice</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All data is stored locally using iOS UserDefaults and remains on your device.
        This data is only accessible by the app and is deleted if you uninstall the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number, etc.)</li>
        <li>Precise or approximate location data</li>
        <li>Device identifiers for tracking (IDFA is not collected or used)</li>
        <li>Photos, videos, or other media files</li>
        <li>Contacts, calendar, or other personal device data</li>
        <li>Payment or financial information</li>
        <li>Browsing history outside the app</li>
        <li>Any data that can personally identify you</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        We use the following third-party services:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase Analytics:</strong> For anonymous, aggregated usage analytics. Firebase is subject to Google's <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/terms" target="_blank">Firebase Terms of Service</a>. No personal information is shared with Firebase.</li>
        <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> For displaying non-personalized advertisements in the app. These ads do not use device identifiers for tracking or ad targeting. For more information, visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google's Advertising Policies</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advertisements</h2>
    <p>
        Our app displays non-personalized advertisements powered by Google AdMob. These ads are shown without using your personal data or device identifiers (IDFA) for targeting purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What this means:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ads are not based on your personal profile or browsing history</li>
        <li>No cross-app tracking is performed</li>
        <li>Ad selection is based only on contextual information (such as the app content)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Your Control:</strong> You can control analytics data collection at any time by going to Settings > Analytics in the app.
    </p>

    <h2>GDPR and Your Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>
        If you are in the European Union or any region with GDPR protections, you have the following rights:

        <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> You can disable analytics collection at any time through Settings > Analytics in the app</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You can opt out of analytics collection through the app settings</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> Since all game progress is stored locally on your device, you have full control over your data</li>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Our app is suitable for all ages and does not collect any personal information from anyone,
        including children under the age of 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take data security seriously. The anonymous analytics data we collect through Firebase is transmitted securely using industry-standard encryption. Since we do not collect any personal information, there is minimal risk to your privacy. All game progress and settings are stored locally on your device and never transmitted to external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over it:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can reset your game progress at any time by reinstalling the app</li>
        <li>You can change your language preference in the app settings</li>
        <li>All data is permanently deleted when you uninstall the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page
        with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
    </p>
