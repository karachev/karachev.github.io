    <h1>Privacy Policy for Guess the Flag</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 15, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how Guess the Flag ("we", "our", or "the app") handles your information.
        We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Guess the Flag is designed with your privacy in mind. We collect minimal, non-personal information to understand how the app is used and to improve your experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Analytics Data</h2>
    <p>
        We use Google Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous, aggregated usage data. This helps us understand:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How users interact with different game modes and features</li>
        <li>Which difficulty levels are most popular</li>
        <li>App stability and performance metrics</li>
        <li>General user engagement patterns</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>What we collect:</strong> Game mode usage, difficulty level selections, session duration, quiz completion rates, and feature interactions. This data is completely anonymous and aggregated.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Data Retention:</strong> Firebase Analytics data is automatically deleted after 60 months (5 years) of inactivity.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Your Control:</strong> You can disable analytics collection at any time through the app's Settings menu. When you disable analytics, no new data is sent to Firebase, though previously collected data cannot be deleted.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Stored Locally</h2>
    <p>The following data is stored only on your device and never transmitted to our servers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Game Progress:</strong> Your best scores for each difficulty level</li>
        <li><strong>Preferences:</strong> Your selected language preference and analytics consent choice</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All data is stored locally using iOS UserDefaults and remains on your device.
        This data is only accessible by the app and is deleted if you uninstall the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number, etc.)</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Device identifiers (IDFA is not used for tracking purposes)</li>
        <li>Crash reports</li>
        <li>Any personal or sensitive information</li>
    </ul>
